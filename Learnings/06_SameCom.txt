### Adding Same Component (Header and Footer) into All Pages

To add the same component, such as a header and footer, to all pages, we can use the `{% include "" %}` tag in the HTML pages where we want the header and footer.

Example:
```html
{% include "header.html" %}
<!-- Main content of the page goes here -->
{% include "footer.html" %}
```

### Using Extends Method for Header and Footer

If we want to create a base template (base.html) that includes both the header and footer, and only exchange the inner content, we use the `extends` method.

1. Create `header.html` and `footer.html`.

2. Create `base.html` and include `{% block %}` sections for dynamic content:
   ```html
   {% include "header.html" %}
   {% block content %}{% endblock %}
   {% include "footer.html" %}
   ```

### Connecting Pages Using Extends

To connect pages and use the base template (`base.html`):

1. Extend `base.html` in the specific page's HTML file.

2. Define `{% block %}` sections to replace content in `base.html`:
   ```html
   {% extends "base.html" %}
   {% block content %}
   <!-- Inner content specific to this page -->
   {% endblock %}
   ```

Note: Replace `"content"` with the appropriate block name used in `base.html`.
- If we want to link Header links to the specific page (/home, /about, /portfolio) then we have to do same endoint in our anker tag of html after making urlls.py and views.py. Or we can also use url name by giving (name="home") into urls path and using it in anchor tag ({ % url "home" % })
