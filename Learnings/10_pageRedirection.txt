## Page Redirection

### Importing HttpResponseRedirect

First, we need to use the `HttpResponseRedirect` method of Django by importing it.

### Redirecting After Form Submission

Lets say After form submission, we can easily redirect the page to another page in `views.py` like this:

```python
from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect

def userForm(request):
    try:
        n1 = request.POST.get("num1")
        n2 = request.POST.get("num2")
        # Process data here
    except:
        pass
    return HttpResponseRedirect('/home/')
```

## Redirecting with Data

To redirect and pass data, simply use:

```python
def userForm(request):
    try:
        n1 = request.POST.get("num1")
        n2 = request.POST.get("num2")
        # Process data here
        data = some_processed_data  # Replace with actual data
        url = '/home/?output={}'.format(data)
        return HttpResponseRedirect(url)
    except:
        pass
    return render(request, "form.html")
```
