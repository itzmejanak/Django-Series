## HTTP Methods

### GET
- Not secure
- Data goes through URL

### POST
- Secure
- Data goes through HTML body

### Form Submission

Let's create a form and send data to the server By Get method.

1. Use the `form` tag and use method.
2. Inside it, use `label` and `input` tags correspondingly.
3. At the end, use a `submit` type button.

**Note**: Try to make the form in a separate HTML file because we can extend the header, footer, and other stuff on that page.

### Handling Form Submission in `views.py`

In the method of `views.py` where `form.html` is being called, we will take the submitted data into that function. We have to use a try-catch block in case any error occurs.

### Inside the `try` Block
We can use the request parameter to access the incoming form values like this:

**Note**: It is necessary to give the input field a name because we will use that name to get data from that field.

```python
def userForm(request):
    try:
        n1 = request.GET.get("num1")
        n2 = request.GET.get("num2")
        print(n1, n2)
    except:
        pass
    return render(request, "form.html")
