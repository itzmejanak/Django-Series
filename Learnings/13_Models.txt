## Models in Django

- Models represent the table in the database.

### Steps to Create and Migrate Models

1. **Define the Models**: After defining the models, you need to create migrations to generate the schema. Then, apply these migrations using the `migrate` command to generate the table.

2. **Generate a New App**: To generate a `models.py` or an app for specific services, use the following command:
   ```bash
   python manage.py startapp <app_name>
   ```

### Creating a Model

1. **Define the Model**:
   - Open `models.py` and import `models` from `django.db`.

   ```python
   from django.db import models

   class Services(models.Model):
       # Define table field names
       icon = models.CharField(max_length=50)
       # Add other fields as needed
   ```

   **Note**: The primary key `id` will be generated automatically and will auto-increment by default.

2. **Configure the App**:
   - Add the created app to `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`:
     ```python
     INSTALLED_APPS = [
         'services',  # Add the app name here
     ]
     ```

3. **Make Migrations**:
   - Convert the model to a migration and then migrate to convert it into a table:
     ```bash
     python manage.py makemigrations
     python manage.py migrate
     ```

### Register the Model in Admin

1. **Check Admin**: If the services model is not visible in the admin, register the model:
   - Go to `admin.py` of the services app.
   - Import the model class:
     ```python
     from services.models import Services
     ```

2. **Create an Admin Class**:
   ```python
   from django.contrib import admin

   class ServicesAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
       # Define the attributes to display in the admin panel
       list_display = ('icon',)  # Add other attributes if needed

   # Register the model with the admin class
   admin.site.register(Services, ServicesAdmin)
   ```
