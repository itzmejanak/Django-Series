### Data Submission by POST Method

To submit data through the POST method, we will use a CSRF token, which helps protect us from spamming by hackers.

### Steps

1. Do the same as with the GET method but change the method of the form to POST.
2. Inside the form, use `{% csrf_token %}`. That's it from the submission side.

### Server-Side Handling

To handle the submitted data on the server side, change `request.GET` to `request.POST`.

### Example

```html
<!-- form.html -->
<form method="post">
    {% csrf_token %}
    <label for="num1">Number 1:</label>
    <input type="text" id="num1" name="num1">
    
    <label for="num2">Number 2:</label>
    <input type="text" id="num2" name="num2">
    
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

```python
# views.py
def userForm(request):
    try:
        n1 = request.POST.get("num1")
        n2 = request.POST.get("num2")
        print(n1, n2)
    except:
        pass
    return render(request, "form.html")
```
